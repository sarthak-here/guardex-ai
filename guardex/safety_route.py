"""User-defined safety routes for custom blocklist categories.

Each route has example utterances and an action ("block" or "flag").
Matching is cosine similarity against the example embeddings - the
inverse of TopicScope (allowlist vs. blocklist).

The engine takes any EmbeddingProvider. Share the same encoder with
TopicScopeEngine to avoid loading the model twice.

Usage::

    from guardex import SafetyRoute, SafetyRouteEngine, SafetyRouteResult
    from guardex import SentenceTransformerEncoder

    routes = [
        SafetyRoute(
            name="competitor_mentions",
            utterances=["What about ProductX?", "Is CompetitorY better?",
                        "Compare with RivalZ", "Switch to AlternativeW"],
            action="block",
            threshold=0.35,
            description="Block mentions of competitor products",
        ),
        SafetyRoute(
            name="insider_trading",
            utterances=["Buy stock before announcement", "Non-public earnings info",
                        "Trade on material information", "Insider knowledge"],

    utterances : list[str]
        Example phrases that should trigger this route.
