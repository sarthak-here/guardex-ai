# Topic scope restriction

@dataclass
class TopicScope:
    """Topic scope restriction configuration.

    Defines which topics the chatbot is allowed to discuss.
    Queries outside these topics will be blocked at the scope gate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    topics : list[str]
        Anchor descriptions defining the allowed scope.
        e.g., ["retail banking", "credit cards", "loan products"]
    utterances : dict[str, list[str]] | None
        Optional per-topic example phrases (semantic-router pattern).
        Much more precise than topics alone - captures the actual query
        distribution instead of a single label.
        e.g., {"banking": ["What's my balance?", "Transfer money"]}
    examples : list[str] | None
        Optional example queries that are in-scope. Improves accuracy.
        e.g., ["What's my account balance?", "How do I apply for a mortgage?"]
    scope_width : str
        How strictly to enforce scope. "narrow" | "moderate" | "broad" | "fitted"
        - narrow: only clearly on-topic queries pass
        - moderate: allows related queries (default)
        - broad: only clearly off-topic is blocked
        - fitted: threshold was optimized via fit()
    threshold : float | None
        Manual cosine similarity threshold override (0.0-1.0).
        If set, overrides scope_width preset.
    alpha : float
        Hybrid matching weight (0.0 = dense only, 1.0 = sparse only).
        Set to 0.3 for hybrid dense+BM25 matching. Only effective when
        utterances are provided (BM25 needs text corpus).
    encoder_type : str | None
        Encoder type for embedding. None = default (sentence-transformer).
        Options: "sentence-transformer", "openai", "fastembed", "ollama".
    encoder_config : dict | None
        Extra kwargs passed to encoder constructor (e.g., model, api_key).

# Main policy

@dataclass
class GuardExPolicy:
    """All tuneable knobs for GuardEx SDK behaviour.

    Parameters
    ----------
    api_key:
        GuardEx API key. Falls back to ``GUARDEX_API_KEY`` env var.
    base_url:
        GuardEx API server URL. Falls back to ``GUARDEX_BASE_URL`` env var.
        Empty (the default when the env var is unset) selects in-process
        local mode; any non-empty value selects server mode.
    block_on_unsafe_input:
        Gates the **safety-classifier verdict only** for input gates
        (``input``, ``prompt``, ``tool_input``, ``retrieval_query``). When
        False, ``screen()`` still reports the unsafe classification, but the
        enforcement methods (``screen_or_raise``, ``GuardedLLM``, the callback
        handler) no longer raise on it - observe-only. Prompt injection, topic
        scope, safety routes, and ``pii_action="block"`` are independent
        controls and always enforce; disable them via ``injection_check=False``,
        ``policy.topic_scope = None``, and ``pii_action="mask"`` respectively.
    block_on_unsafe_output:
        Same rule as ``block_on_unsafe_input`` but for output gates
        (``output``, ``tool_output``, ``retrieval_result``).
    blocked_categories:
        LlamaGuard category codes that trigger a block. Granular per-category
        filtering requires LlamaGuard (via Ollama) or a multilabel classifier.
        The default local binary classifier only distinguishes safe/toxic, so a
        customized subset has no fine-grained effect in local "speed" mode.
    fail_open:
        When True, treat server errors as SAFE (log warning).
        When False, raise on any server failure.
        Note: 401/403/422 always raise regardless of this setting.
    pii_enabled:
        Enable PII detection.
    pii_entities:
        Entity labels to detect.
    pii_action:
        'mask' to replace PII with placeholders, 'block' to raise PIIViolation.
    pii_threshold:
        Confidence threshold for PII detection.
    cascade_mode:
        ``'safety'`` runs all checks fully; ``'speed'`` enables server-side fast path.
    audit_logging:
        When True, every screening decision is emitted as a structured log entry
        at INFO level and forwarded to the server for dashboard audit trails.
    detailed_logging:
        When True, full request/response payloads are logged at DEBUG level.
    classify_min_confidence:
        Minimum confidence required to treat a classification as valid.
        Set to e.g. ``0.7`` to auto-pass low-confidence unsafe classifications.
        Default ``0.0`` means trust the server classification unconditionally.
    grounding_mode:
        Override grounding check mode. ``None`` uses the server default.
        ``'speed'`` uses embedding similarity; ``'accuracy'`` uses NLI cross-encoder.
    grounding_threshold:
        Per-sentence grounded score threshold. ``None`` uses the server default.
